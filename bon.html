   <p class="lyrics">Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think<br>
    I'm in the bathroom, looking at me<br>
    Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)<br>
    Wait until the reaper takes my life<br>
    Never gonna get me out alive<br>
    I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)<br>
    My patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    Our patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
    Where I'm losing all control<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul<br>
    Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
    Playing with a stick of dynamite<br>
    There was never gray in black and white<br>
    There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)<br>
    Feeling like a boulder hurtling<br>
    Seeing all the vultures circling<br>
    Burning in the flames I'm working in<br>
    Turning in a bed that's darkening<br>
    My patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    Our patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
    Where I'm losing all control<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul<br>
    Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones<br>
    Look in the mirror of my mind<br>
    Turning the pages of my life<br>
    Walking the path so many paced a million times<br>
    Drown out the voices in the air<br>
    Leaving the ones that never cared<br>
    Picking the pieces up and building to the sky<br>
    My patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    My patience is waning<br>
    Is this entertaining?<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>
    Where I'm losing all control<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)<br>
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)<br>
    Go ahead and throw your stones<br>
    'Cause there's magic in<br>
    There goes my mind (I-I-I)<br>
    Don't mind<br>
    There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)<br>
    There goes my mind (I-I-I)<br>
    Don't mind (there it goes)<br>
    There goes my mind<br>
    'Cause there's magic in my bones</p>

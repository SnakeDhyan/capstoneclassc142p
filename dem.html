   <p class="lyrics">When the days are cold<br>
    And the cards all fold<br>
    And the saints we see<br>
    Are all made of gold<br>
    When your dreams they fail<br>
    And the ones we hail<br>
    Are the worst of all<br>
    And the blood's run stale<br>
    I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you<br>
    But with the beast inside<br>
    There's nowhere we can hide<br>
    No matter what we breed<br>
    We still are made of greed<br>
    This is my kingdom come<br>
    This is my kingdom come<br>
    When you feel my heat<br>
    Look into my eyes<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    Don't get too close<br>
    It's dark inside<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    When the curtain's call<br>
    It's the last of all<br>
    When the lights fade out<br>
    All the sinners crawl<br>
    So they dug your grave<br>
    And the masquerade<br>
    Will come calling out<br>
    At the mess you've made<br>
    Don't wanna let you down<br>
    But I am hell bound<br>
    Though this is all for you<br>
    Don't wanna hide the truth<br>
    No matter what we breed<br>
    We still are made of greed<br>
    This is my kingdom come<br>
    This is my kingdom come<br>
    When you feel my heat<br>
    Look into my eyes<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    Don't get too close<br>
    It's dark inside<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    They say it's what you make<br>
    I say it's up to fate<br>
    It's woven in my soul<br>
    I need to let you go<br>
    Your eyes, they shine so bright<br>
    I wanna save that light<br>
    I can't escape this now<br>
    Unless you show me how<br>
    When you feel my heat<br>
    Look into my eyes<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    Don't get too close<br>
    It's dark inside<br>
    It's where my demons hide<br>
    It's where my demons hide</p>

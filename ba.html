   <p class="lyrics">Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
    Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
    Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
    You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)<br>
    Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)<br>
    You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)<br>
    And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)<br>
    Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)<br>
    "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)<br>
    Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)<br>
    My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine<br>
    Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (uh-huh)<br>
    And I just can't believe we ain't together (yo, uh-huh)<br>
    And I wanna play it cool (yo), but I'm losin' you (uh-huh)<br>
    I'll buy you anything (yo), I'll buy you any ring (uh-huh)<br>
    And I'm in pieces (yo), baby, fix me (uh-huh)<br>
    And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream (yo, uh-huh)<br>
    I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)<br>
    And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)<br>
    When I was 13, I had my first love<br>
    There was nobody that compared to my baby<br>
    And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above<br>
    She had me goin' crazy<br>
    Oh, I was starstruck<br>
    She woke me up daily<br>
    Don't need no Starbucks (woo)<br>
    She made my heart pound<br>
    And skip a beat when I see her in the street and<br>
    At school on the playground<br>
    But I really wanna see her on the weekend<br>
    She knows she got me dazin'<br>
    'Cause she was so amazin'<br>
    And now, my heart is breakin'<br>
    But I just keep on sayin'<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine<br>
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"<br>
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"<br>
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine<br>
    I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
    Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
    Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
    Now, I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)<br>
    I'm gone</p>

   <p class="lyrics">Trouble
    Blood is in the rocky waters<br>
    Hide away your sons and daughters<br>
    Eat you alive<br>
    Levels<br>
    Better put your head on swivels<br>
    Dancing with the very devil<br>
    Butter to knife<br>
    You think you're better than them<br>
    Better than them<br>
    You think they're really your friends<br>
    Really your friends<br>
    But when it comes to the end<br>
    To the end<br>
    You're just the same as them<br>
    Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)<br>
    So let it go, let it go<br>
    That's the way that it goes<br>
    First you're in, then you're out<br>
    Everybody knows<br>
    You're hot, then you're cold<br>
    You're a light in the dark<br>
    Just you wait and you'll see<br>
    That you're swimmin' with sharks<br>
    He's comin' to get you<br>
    (Chick, chicka) Woo, woo<br>
    He's comin' to get you, get<br>
    (Chicka) Woo<br>
    Bubbles<br>
    Drownin', you're seein' doubles<br>
    Don't you let 'em see your struggles<br>
    Hiding your tears<br>
    Crisis<br>
    Take advantage off your niceness<br>
    Cut you up in even slices<br>
    Prey on your fears<br>
    You think you're better than them<br>
    Better than them (you think you're better)<br>
    You think they're really your friends<br>
    Really your friends (really)<br>
    But when it comes to the end<br>
    To the end (oh, no)<br>
    You're just the same as them<br>
    Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)<br>
    So let it go, let it go<br>
    That's the way that it goes<br>
    First you're in, then you're out<br>
    Everybody knows (ooh)<br>
    You're hot, then you're cold<br>
    You're a light in the dark<br>
    Just you wait and you'll see<br>
    That you're swimmin' with sharks<br>
    He's comin' to get you<br>
    (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get<br>
    (Don't take it from me)<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you<br>
    (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get<br>
    (Don't take it from me)<br>
    Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe<br>
    I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy<br>
    My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me<br>
    Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything<br>
    (Sharks)<br>
    Don't take it from me<br>
    My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks)<br>
    Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything<br>
    So let it go, let it go<br>
    That's the way that it goes<br>
    First you're in, then you're out<br>
    Everybody knows<br>
    You're hot, then you're cold<br>
    You're a light in the dark<br>
    Just you wait and you'll see<br>
    That you're swimmin' with sharks<br>
    He's comin' to get you<br>
    (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get<br>
    (Don't take it from me)<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you<br>
    (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo<br>
    (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get<br>
    (Don't take it from me</p>

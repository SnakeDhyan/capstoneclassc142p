   <p class="lyrics">
    First things first<br>
    I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
    I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
    The way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
    
    Second things second<br>
    Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
    I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
    The master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
    
    I was broken from a young age<br>
    Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
    Writing my poems for the few<br>
    That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
    Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
    Taking my message from the veins<br>
    Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
    Seeing the beauty through the...<br>
    
    Pain!<br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
    
    Third things third<br>
    Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
    All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br>
    Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br>
    
    I was choking in the crowd<br>
    Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
    Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
    Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
    Inhibited, limited<br>
    Till it broke open and rained down<br>
    It rained down, like...<br>
    
    Pain!
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
    
    Last things last<br>
    By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
    You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
    The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
    Inhibited, limited<br>
    Till it broke open and rained down<br>
    It rained down, like...<br>
    
    Pain!<br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
    Pain!<br>
    Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
    Pain!<br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believe</p>

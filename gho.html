   <p class="lyrics">Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow<br>
    I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow<br>
    I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow<br>
    Since the love that you left is all that I get<br>
    I want you to know<br>
    That if I can't be close to you<br>
    I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
    I miss you more than life (more than life)<br>
    And if you can't be next to me<br>
    Your memory is ecstasy<br>
    I miss you more than life<br>
    I miss you more than life<br>
    Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow<br>
    I need more time but time can't be borrowed<br>
    I'd leave it all behind if I could follow<br>
    Since the love that you left is all that I get<br>
    I want you to know<br>
    That if I can't be close to you<br>
    I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
    I miss you more than life (yeah)<br>
    And if you can't be next to me<br>
    Your memory is ecstasy (oh)<br>
    I miss you more than life<br>
    I miss you more than life<br>
    Whoa<br>
    Na, na-na<br>
    More than life<br>
    (Oh)<br>
    So if I can't get close to you<br>
    I'll settle for the ghost of you<br>
    But I miss you more than life<br>
    And if you can't be next to me<br>
    Your memory is ecstasy<br>
    I miss you more than life<br>
    I miss you more than life</p>

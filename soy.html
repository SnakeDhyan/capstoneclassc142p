   <p class="lyrics">The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
    So the bar is where I go<br>
    Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
    Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
    Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
    And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
    Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
    And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like<br>
    Girl, you know I want your love<br>
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
    Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
    Although my heart is falling too<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    Last night you were in my room<br>
    And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
    One week in we let the story begin<br>
    We're going out on our first date<br>
    You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
    And how your family is doing okay<br>
    And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
    Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br>
    Girl, you know I want your love<br>
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
    Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
    Although my heart is falling too<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    Last night you were in my room<br>
    And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>

    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with your body<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
    Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on<br>
    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
    I'm in love with the shape of you</p>

   <p class="lyrics">I found a love, for me<br>
    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
    Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
    Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
    Not knowing what it was<br>
    I will not give you up this time<br>
    But darling, just kiss me slow<br>
    Your heart is all I own<br>
    And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br>
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
    With you between my arms<br>
    Barefoot on the grass<br>
    Listening to our favourite song<br>
    When you said you looked a mess<br>
    I whispered underneath my breath<br>
    But you heard it<br>
    Darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
    Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
    She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
    I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
    To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
    We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
    Fighting against all odds<br>
    I know we'll be alright this time<br>
    Darling, just hold my hand<br>
    Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
    I see my future in your eyes<br>
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
    With you between my arms<br>
    Barefoot on the grass<br>
    Listening to our favorite song<br>
    When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
    I don't deserve this<br>
    Darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
    With you between my arms<br>
    Barefoot on the grass<br>
    Listening to our favorite song<br>
    I have faith in what I see<br>
    Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
    And she looks perfect<br>
    I don't deserve this<br>
    You look perfect tonight</p>

   <p class="lyrics">I took an arrow to the heart<br>
    I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours<br>
    Strawberries and somethin' more<br>
    Ooh yeah, I want it all<br>
    Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)<br>
    Fill up the engine, we can drive real far<br>
    Go dancin' underneath the stars<br>
    Ooh yeah, I want it all<br>
    Mm, you got me feelin' like<br>
    I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes<br>
    I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm<br>
    Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night<br>
    Yeah, you got me singin' like<br>
    Ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
    And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
    Into the car<br>
    On the backseat in the moonlit dark<br>
    Wrap me up between your legs and arms<br>
    Ooh, I can't get enough<br>
    You know you could tear me apart (ooh)<br>
    Put me back together and take my heart<br>
    I never thought that I could love this hard<br>
    Ooh, I can't get enough<br>
    Mm, you got me feeling like<br>
    I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes<br>
    I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm<br>
    Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night<br>
    Yeah, you got me singin' like<br>
    Ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
    And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back<br>
    Baby, you burn so hot<br>
    You make me shiver with the fire you got<br>
    This thing we started, I don't want it to stop<br>
    You know you make me shiver-er-er<br>
    Baby, you burn so hot<br>
    You make me shiver with the fire you got<br>
    This thing we started, I don't want it to stop<br>
    You know you make me shiver<br>
    Yeah, you got me singin' like<br>
    Ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (oh no)<br>
    And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that<br>
    And when you're close up, give me the shivers<br>
    Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks<br>
    And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey</p>

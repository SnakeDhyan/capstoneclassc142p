    One, two, three, four<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no<br>
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control<br>
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes<br>
And tonight had something wonderful<br>
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br>
Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br>
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't<br>
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br>
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space<br>
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say<br>
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br>
Nothin' happens after two, it's true<br>
It's true, my bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
My bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
My bad habits lead to you<br>
Every pure intention ends when the good times start<br>
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark<br>
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark<br>
I only know how to go too far<br>
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br>
Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br>
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't<br>
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br>
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space<br>
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say<br>
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br>
Nothin' happens after two, it's true<br>
It's true, my bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
My bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
We took the long way 'round<br>
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now<br>
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br>
Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br>
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't<br>
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br>
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space<br>
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say<br>
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br>
Nothin' happens after two, it's true<br>
It's true, my bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
My bad habits lead to you<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
My bad habits lead to you</p>

   <p class="lyrics">
    When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>
    And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>
    Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>
    Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks<br>
    And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70<br>
    And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>
    And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
    Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
    Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>
    And I just wanna tell you I am<br>
    So honey now<br>
    Take me into your loving arms<br>
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
    Place your head on my beating heart<br>
    I'm thinking out loud<br>
    Maybe we found love right where we are<br>
    When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
    And the crowds don't remember my name<br>
    When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm<br>
    I know you will still love me the same<br>
    'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen<br>
    Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory<br>
    I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
    Maybe it's all part of a plan<br>
    I'll just keep on making the same mistakes<br>
    Hoping that you'll understand<br>
    But baby now<br>
    Take me into your loving arms<br>
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
    Place your head on my beating heart<br>
    I'm thinking out loud<br>
    That maybe we found love right where we are, oh<br>
    So baby now<br>
    Take me into your loving arms<br>
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
    Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>
    I'm thinking out loud<br>
    That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
    Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)<br>
    And we found love right where we are</p>
